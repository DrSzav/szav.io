            With a background in both computer science and art, I merge technical expertise with a creative approach to
            problem-solving. My academic journey focused on algorithms, mixed media art, interactive installations, nd
            digital sensors. From programming interactive art with Arduinos to building advanced software systems, I aim
            to create experiences that connect technology and human interaction in innovative ways. Beyond development,
            I also have deep interests in sound design, music production, and filmmaking, constantly seeking to push the
            boundaries of creativity and technology.
